## üè• Project Overview

MedicalAGI operates through various intelligent agents, each holding specific roles within a multi-agent organizational structure. These roles include Triage Nurses, Nursing staff, Medical students, interns, residents, consultants, hospital administration, allied health staff, pharmaceutical staff, medical device staff, repair staff, security, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Product Officer, Chief Technology Officer, programmer, reviewer, tester, and art designer.

The primary mission of MedicalAGI is to revolutionize the digital healthcare landscape through advanced diagnosis and management. The intelligent agents collaborate through specialized functional seminars, covering tasks such as triaging, Outpatients, Inpatients, Diagnosis, Treatments, designing, coding, testing, and documenting.

## Project outcome
- Its made to surface the underlying meta-language of medicine and healthcare through concept building the unchartered language of biosemiotics especially in humans. 
- Automation of every aspect of healthcare to precipitate new knowledge, concept and cures through ongoing recursive reiteration of software on real world patients and humans
- The surface knowledge generating software is meant to be run parallely in many servers across the world connected to each other through cloud- to complete the human medical knowledge
- This completed medical knowledge can be used to cure mortality
